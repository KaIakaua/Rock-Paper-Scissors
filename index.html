    console.log("The script is on");
    console.log("The script has loaded");

    const textArray = ['Rock','Paper','Scissors' ]; //The options that the computer has

    const Rock = 0;
    const Paper = 1;
    const Scissors = 2;

    console.log(textArray + " are the options.");

//So far it works up to here. It has the needed variables for the choices.

    function getComputerChoice(stringArray) {
        let randomSelect = Math.floor(Math.random()*stringArray.length); //Randomly select one of the options
        let randomElement = stringArray[randomSelect]; //Return the selected choice.

//Now it works all the way over here, properly choosing a random value from the 3 options.
//And this value is the same inside and outside the function so no confusion made.


//-----------------

//Ok so first thing I should do is to remember how to make functions, 
//then create a function that will randomly return a value from 3 choices.
//That would be the case but before that I will put the variables right there.

//DONE

//------------------------
    function getPlayerChoice() {
        let choice = prompt("Choose Rock, Paper or Scissors:").toLowerCase();

        while (!["rock", "paper", "scissors"].includes(choice)) {
            choice = prompt("Invalid choice! Choose Rock, Paper or Scissors:").toLowerCase();
        }
        console.log(choice + " is the choice");
    return choice;
    }

    const playerSelection = getPlayerChoice();
    console.log(playerSelection + " is the PlayerSelection");

    function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {
        alert(input);
    }





//Then second thing is to make a function that will play a game of 
//Rock Paper Scissors with the user, this will happen by letting the user
//pick one option from those 3 previous values, and then the computer
//will do the same. 
//After this is done, a string will return declaring the result of the game
//and it will be different based in if the user won or lost the game.
