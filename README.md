# Rock-Paper-Scissors

-------------------------------------------
To not put much effort into going back and forth between windows and ubuntu i'll put comments and/or issues here.

I have now finished the interaction between the user choice and the computer choice.
As I am writting this I do not see any big errors anywhere,
but i'm sure that's bound to change on closer inspection in a few days or so.
----------------------------------------------------

I believe this is now finished, probably most likely not but I don't see any major errors anymore and its does what its supposed to so.
